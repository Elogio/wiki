GameMaker Studio is a game engine developed by YoYo Games, allowing to create all types of 2D games, using visual scripting or a programming language called GameMaker Language. The software is designed to be accessible to beginners who do not master advanced programming languages, but offers extensive functionalities to attract developers who desire to create complete and complex games. It can be used on Windows and macOS.

GameMaker allows you to export your games for Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, HTML5, Android, iOS; Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Microsoft UWP, PS4, Xbox One and Switch.

Certain old versions of GameMaker also supported PS3, PS Vita and Tizen.

## Programming on GameMaker

### Drag and Drop

Drag and Drop is the visual scripting tool of GameMaker. It allows you to realize various tasks without having to write a single line of code. The target audience is mostly beginners, as proficiency in GameMaker Language allows you to be more efficient.

Since GameMaker Studio 2, Drag and Drop is more powerful and displays in real time the code produced in GML, thus we can learn quite easily and effortlessly the language.

### GameMaker Language

Le GML est un langage de script spécifique à GameMaker. Il a pour objectif d'accomoder les développeurs de différents styles : les mots-clé `and` et `or` fonctionnent conjointement avec `&&` et `||`, les parenthèses dans les conditions et les boucles peuvent être omises, tout comme les points-virgules.

GML is GameMaker's own scripting language. The aim of GML is to please developers with various coding styles: the keywords `and` and `or` work together with `&&` and `||`, brackets and semicolons in conditionals and loops may be omitted.

## Getting GameMaker

GameMaker Studio 2 can be bought on [YoYo Games](https://www.yoyogames.com/) website or via an official retailer like [Humble Store](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/search?search=gamemaker). Buying the software on Steam is not a good idea: you can't launch several instances simultaneously, it doesn't work when Steam is offline, the updates are always served late and the Marketplace is unavailable.

### Free trial

The Trial licence can be obtained by creating a YoYo account. It allows you to get used to the software by creating small projects. With this version, you can test your game, but you can't export it. Other limitations exist and are listed in [this article](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230407528).

### Paid offers

Developer licenses grant a full and lifelong access to the software on Windows and macOS. The entry-level license allows you to publish your game on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu, whereas other options offer to aim more platforms.

The Creator license, less expensive, is valid for a year and only works for the OS chosen during the purchase. For instance, by buying a Windows Creator license, you could only export your games for Windows. Moreover, by logging in to the software on macOS, you would be limited to the Trial version. Finally, exported games include a splash screen at launch.

All the other features are exactly the same as in the Developer version, which makes it a perfect compromise for those who desire to develop seriously their projects without having to pay the entire price right from the beginning. Having the Creator license grants a 30% discount on the purchase of a Developer licence, therefore you will be able to go further when you'll feel ready for it.

Lastly, Console licenses are valid for a year and require you to be a registered developer at Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft to be fully used.

## Games created with GameMaker

GameMaker is used to create prototypes but also to realize great indie productions. The engine proved its viability for a commercial use several times with well-known games such as Undertale, Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, Gunpoint, etc. You can visit the [official showcase](https://www.yoyogames.com/showcase) for an exhaustive list.
