title: "Realizing a press kit"

A press kit contains information that will ease the creation of articles about your game: high quality images, your logo, information on your game and your contact details. It must be simple to find on your official website.

This information might already be on your site, that’s why the press kit isn’t mandatory. However, it is of common use in order to improve the interactions with editors. You can realize this page by yourself or use presskit() which will create a readable page in a standard format.

### Installing presskit()

Obtain presskit() from the [official website](http://dopresskit.com/). The archive contains an `install.php` file.

Open the FTP of your site and create a folder named `presskit` (or any other name of your choice). Copy there the `install.php` file and then open it in your browser. The page should display this.

On your FTP, your folder `presskit` now contains several files. Start by adding images in the appropriate folder and then edit `_data.xml` in the text editor of your choice. Notepad can do the job, but it will be more pleasant on a proper code editor.

After having executed all the instructions, access once again the folder from your browser: your press kit is ready.
