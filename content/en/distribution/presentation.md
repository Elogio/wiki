title: "Showing off your game"
---

The indie game's world is overcrowded: almost 800 games are added each month on Steam, and the number is constantly increasing. Every store is following this trend, consoles included. With such a competition, how to stand out?

## The title

A good title is suggestive: by reading it, one could already imagine what game they're going to face. A cryptic title will on the contrary create suspicion. People will be more inclined to try your game if they can get an idea of it by looking at its name.

It is also essential for your title to be easily written and pronounced. Your game will appear more easily in search engines, and word of mouth will also be simpler. Those two aspects are fundamental to promote a game! Test the name with friends: tell them the title and ask them to write it down. Also try the opposite, so you'll be sure that the pronunciation is always the same.

Finding a name that pleases you is usually quite simple. The true difficulty is to find one that hasn't been used already. Check it on Google, Steam and other stores. It is also worth to check the domain name and the URL availability on social media. Don't hesitate to take them in advance.

## The thumbnail

The first step to get players is to lead them to your page. By browsing the store, thousands of visitors will see your thumbnail among all the others. How to draw their attention and incite them to check your image in particular?

Don't hesitate to perfect your thumbnail: it is a key driver to enhance your traffic. It will appear not only in the store but also every time the link will be shared, on social media as well as in messaging apps. It must be sufficiently intriguing to catch the eye in a fraction of a second.

The text is usually an important part of a thumbnail, and to make it readable, you can play with contrasts. Be creative and use the various visual attributes of your elements: you can design contrast with colours, shapes and sizes.

Furthermore, you should take into account that the text is going to be displayed at different scales. The thumbnail must be clear on the small overview of the store, but we must be able to appreciate more delicate details when it's displayed on social medias. Generally, stores allow you to host a different picture for each context. It's really convenient to assure you a pleasant first contact with the game, wherever it happens.

## The page

On itch.io, you have different tools to customize your game page and convey its identity. Changing the colours creates a more striking atmosphere while only requiring a minute or two. With more attention and creativity, you can completely transform it, like [Cityglitch](https://mindfungus.itch.io/cityglitch) and [Indigo Child](https://metkis.itch.io/indigo-child) did for example.

## La description

A game's description is usually skimmed over by players, perhaps even completely ignored. Notice how, on Steam and game consoles, the description is often hidden or truncated to offer more space to the pictures and users' reviews.

When you're writing, you should keep in mind that your readers already found your game and that their curiosity has been appealed enough by the images, and that's the reason why they are reading the description. The first impression is already a success: you just have to find the right words to close the deal.

List clearly the main strengths of you game. Chances are that you already identified those points during the developing process, and through your conversations with the public and the press. Thus it should be quite an easy step!
