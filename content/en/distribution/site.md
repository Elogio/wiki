Selon l'importance de votre projet, il peut être intéressant de créer un site vitrine pour présenter votre jeu au public et à la presse. Certaines solutions sont très économiques et relativement rapides à mettre en place.

Depending on the importance of your project, it could be interesting to create a showcase website to present your game to the public and the press. Some solutions are particularly affordable and relatively quick to set up.

## Inspirations

Here are some examples of indie games’ official websites:

- [Eldritch](http://www.eldritchgame.com/)
- [Chasm](http://www.chasmgame.com/)
- [Savant: Ascent](http://savantgame.com/)
- [Owlboy](http://owlboygame.com/)
- [Ether One](http://www.ether-game.com/)

Images and videos are often the most important parts, therefore they must be seen first. Then, the main strengths of your game are detailed for the most curious visitors. Notice that each link is easily accessible: social media, stores, press kit, etc.

## Renting a domain name

A `.com` domain name usually costs around 10$ per year. Several sites offer you to buy one, such as:

- [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net)
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google)
- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)
- [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)

## Renting an hosting

Now that you possess a domain name, you have to rent a storage space to drop in your webpages. Some sites present basic free offers, which can be enough to host a few permanent pages. You can also use services to create pages and blogs without ads, such as Github Pages and Tumblr, and then redirect the content to your domain name. Here are some suggestions:

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)
- [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

## Creating web pages

If you aren’t using services like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), you can download an HTML template, and then modify the content and the images. You will find qualitative free templates on HTML5 UP. The code is designed to be customized, so the structure is especially clear even for neophytes.

There are also tool collections for web design with a visual interface, such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/).
